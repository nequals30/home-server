# Logger
This creates a markdown file with a placeholder for each script run by cron. As scripts run, it logs their success or error message. At the end, it gets turned into an HTML page that is hosted on my server, so I can see how things went.

There is a `config.txt` file that looks like this:
```
log_directory = ./logs/
html_out_path = ./result.html
html_n_days_history = 10
```

The process works as follows:
* Running `start_log` will create a markdown file in the directory specified by `log_directory` in the config file.
* In `logger_tools` there is a function `log_entry()` which will update the markdown file with a message generated by each script.
* Finally, `end_write_logs` will turn that markdown file into an HTML file at the path specified by `html_out_path` in the config. It will also add the last N days of logs to that HTML file, as specified by `html_n_days_history`
